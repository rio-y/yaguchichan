# yagutichann
We are creating 3D Yagutichan!

If you make new accessory parts or new clothes, you push the new file in main branch.
If you change the existing files, you make new branch such as "feature1" and push the file in it.

In texture file, you can get texture for 3Dmodel (for yaguchi_3Dmodel_vrm.blend). In addition, you may find some file written "shadow". They are used for texture for shadow.
